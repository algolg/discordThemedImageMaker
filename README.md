# discordThemedImageMaker
A program that makes images that look differently depending on whether users are in Discord's Dark or Light mode.

## Instructions

2. Install Pillow (the Python module involved with imaging)
```
pip install Pillow
```
3. Run `main.py`
4. Follow the instructions given in the Python terminal; the image should output as `output.png` or some variation of it.
